### **What Are Greedy Algorithms?**
Greedy algorithms involve making the best choice at each step without reconsidering previous choices, aiming for an optimal solution. They are efficient but require careful validation to ensure the greedy approach yields the correct result. Common applications include scheduling, graph problems (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree, Shortest Path), and optimization tasks.

### **19 Tips and Strategies for Solving Greedy Algorithm Problems**
1. **Understand the Problem**: Identify the objective (e.g., maximize/minimize) and constraints to determine if a greedy approach is viable.
2. **Identify the Greedy Choice**: Look for a locally optimal decision (e.g., picking the smallest/largest element) that could lead to a global solution.
3. **Prove the Greedy Choice**: Use proof by contradiction or induction to ensure the greedy choice is safe and leads to an optimal solution.
4. **Sort the Data**: Sorting (e.g., ascending/descending order) often simplifies the problem by prioritizing elements for the greedy choice.
5. **Use a Priority Queue**: For dynamic greedy choices, a priority queue (min-heap or max-heap) efficiently selects the next optimal element.
6. **Check for Overlaps**: In interval-based problems, sort by start or end times to handle overlapping intervals greedily.
7. **Greedy with Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to optimize decisions, such as comparing elements from two sorted arrays.
8. **Incremental Approach**: Build the solution step-by-step, ensuring each greedy choice maintains feasibility.
9. **Handle Edge Cases**: Test for empty inputs, single elements, or extreme values to ensure robustness.
10. **Think in Terms of Intervals**: For scheduling or partitioning, represent the problem as intervals to make greedy decisions.
11. **Use Frequency or Counting**: For problems involving repetition, count frequencies and process them greedily (e.g., highest frequency first).
12. **Maximize or Minimize**: Determine whether the problem requires maximizing (e.g., profit) or minimizing (e.g., cost) and align the greedy strategy.
13. **Greedy with Backtracking**: If a greedy choice fails, consider backtracking to explore alternative choices (rarely needed).
14. **Validate Feasibility**: Ensure each greedy step maintains the problem’s constraints (e.g., capacity, time limits).
15. **Think About Local vs. Global**: Confirm that local optimal choices accumulate to a global optimum.
16. **Use Greedy for Subproblems**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems where greedy choices can be applied.
17. **Practice Pattern Recognition**: Familiarize yourself with common greedy problem patterns (e.g., activity selection, knapsack variants).
18. **Optimize Time Complexity**: Aim for efficient solutions using sorting or heaps, typically O(n log n) or better.
19. **Debug with Counterexamples**: Test the greedy approach with counterexamples to verify correctness.

### **When to Use Greedy Algorithms**
Greedy algorithms work best when:
- The problem has the **greedy-choice property**: A global optimum can be reached by making locally optimal choices.
- The problem has **optimal substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
Examples include activity selection, fractional knapsack, and Huffman coding. However, greedy algorithms may fail for problems like the 0/1 knapsack, where dynamic programming is needed.

### **10 Classic Greedy Algorithm Problems and Solutions**
The article provides detailed explanations and solutions for the following LeetCode problems, each illustrating a greedy approach:
1. **Activity Selection (LeetCode 252: Meeting Rooms)**: Sort intervals by end time and select non-overlapping meetings to maximize the number of meetings.
2. **Fractional Knapsack**: Select items by value-to-weight ratio to maximize value within a capacity constraint.
3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s Algorithm)**: Greedily select the smallest-weight edges that don’t form a cycle.
4. **Huffman Coding**: Use a min-heap to build an optimal prefix-free code by combining the least frequent characters.
5. **Job Scheduling with Deadlines**: Schedule jobs with maximum profit by sorting by profit and assigning to the latest possible deadline.
6. **Coin Change (LeetCode 322)**: Minimize the number of coins needed by greedily selecting the largest denomination (works for certain coin systems).
7. **Maximum Subarray (LeetCode 53)**: Use Kadane’s algorithm to greedily track the maximum sum subarray by extending or resetting at each step.
8. **Gas Station (LeetCode 134)**: Greedily check if a starting point allows completing a circular route by tracking total and current gas.
9. **Jump Game (LeetCode 55)**: Greedily track the farthest reachable index to determine if the end can be reached.
10. **Partition Labels (LeetCode 763)**: Greedily partition a string into the smallest possible segments by tracking the last occurrence of each character.

### **Key Patterns and Techniques**
- **Sorting**: Used in problems like Activity Selection and Partition Labels to order elements for greedy selection.
- **Priority Queue**: Applied in Huffman Coding and problems requiring dynamic selection of minimum/maximum elements.
- **Interval Problems**: Sorting by end time or start time is common in scheduling and interval-based problems.
- **Greedy Validation**: Always verify the greedy approach with proofs or test cases to avoid incorrect solutions.

### **Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**
- **Incorrect Greedy Choice**: Ensure the greedy choice leads to a global optimum (e.g., test with counterexamples).
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Handle boundary conditions like empty inputs or invalid states.
- **Overcomplicating the Solution**: Prefer simpler greedy strategies over complex alternatives unless necessary.
- **Assuming Greedy Works**: Some problems (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack) require dynamic programming instead of a greedy approach.
