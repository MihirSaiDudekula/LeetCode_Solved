Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation for each of the key concepts, with examples to make them clearer:

### **1. Bitwise Operators:**

#### **AND (`&`)**
- **Explanation**: The bitwise AND operator compares each corresponding bit of two numbers. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 0. This operation is useful for checking or manipulating specific bits.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  5  =  0101 (binary)
  3  =  0011 (binary)
  ----------
  5 & 3 = 0001 (binary) → 1 (decimal)
  ```
  Here, the bits are compared bit by bit. Only the last bit is 1 in both 5 and 3, so the result is `0001` (which is 1 in decimal).

- **Common Use**: You can use AND to check if a particular bit is set (e.g., `num & (1 << i)`), or to mask out certain bits (i.e., set them to zero).

---

#### **OR (`|`)**
- **Explanation**: The bitwise OR operator compares each corresponding bit of two numbers. If either of the bits is 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 0. This operation is useful for setting specific bits in a number.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  5  =  0101 (binary)
  3  =  0011 (binary)
  ----------
  5 | 3 = 0111 (binary) → 7 (decimal)
  ```
  In this case, any bit that is 1 in either of the operands becomes 1 in the result. Thus, the result is `0111` (which is 7 in decimal).

- **Common Use**: OR is typically used to set a bit (e.g., `num | (1 << i)`).

---

#### **XOR (`^`)**
- **Explanation**: The XOR (exclusive OR) operator compares two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different (i.e., one is 0 and the other is 1), and 0 if the bits are the same. It is often used to toggle bits or find differences.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  5  =  0101 (binary)
  3  =  0011 (binary)
  ----------
  5 ^ 3 = 0110 (binary) → 6 (decimal)
  ```
  Here, the result is 1 where the bits differ and 0 where the bits are the same. The result `0110` is 6 in decimal.

- **Common Use**: XOR is useful for toggling bits (i.e., flipping a bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) and for operations like swapping numbers without a temporary variable.

---

#### **NOT (`~`)**
- **Explanation**: The bitwise NOT operator inverts all the bits in a number: it turns all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s. This operation is often used in two’s complement representation for negative numbers.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  5  =  0101 (binary)
  ~5 =  1010 (binary) → -6 (decimal)
  ```
  The result of `~5` is `1010` in binary, which is -6 in two’s complement.

- **Common Use**: The NOT operator is used when flipping all bits, such as for creating the negative of a number in two’s complement form.

---

#### **Left Shift (`<<`)**
- **Explanation**: The left shift operator shifts all the bits in a binary number to the left by a specified number of positions. Each left shift operation effectively multiplies the number by 2 (ignoring overflow).

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  5  =  0101 (binary)
  5 << 1 = 1010 (binary) → 10 (decimal)
  ```
  Shifting `5` left by 1 bit results in `1010` (which is 10 in decimal). Every left shift multiplies the number by 2.

- **Common Use**: Left shift is commonly used to multiply a number by powers of 2 or to allocate space in data structures like bit arrays.

---

#### **Right Shift (`>>`)**
- **Explanation**: The right shift operator shifts all the bits in a binary number to the right by a specified number of positions. Each right shift operation effectively divides the number by 2 (ignoring overflow).

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  5  =  0101 (binary)
  5 >> 1 = 0010 (binary) → 2 (decimal)
  ```
  Shifting `5` right by 1 bit results in `0010` (which is 2 in decimal). Every right shift divides the number by 2.

- **Common Use**: Right shift is often used to divide a number by powers of 2, or to process data bit by bit (e.g., when extracting individual bits).

---

### **2. Applications of Bitwise Operations:**

#### **Checking if a number is a power of 2**
- **Explanation**: A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set to 1. A clever way to check this is to use the expression `x & (x - 1)`. If `x` is a power of 2, this operation will yield 0, because subtracting 1 from a power of 2 flips all the bits to the right of the most significant bit, which will turn off the only 1-bit in the number.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  4 = 100 (binary), 4 - 1 = 011 (binary)
  4 & (4 - 1) = 100 & 011 = 000 (binary) → 0 (decimal)
  ```
  If the result is 0, the number is a power of 2.

---

#### **Counting the number of 1-bits in a number**
- **Explanation**: You can count the number of 1-bits in a number by repeatedly removing the least significant set bit. The operation `n = n & (n - 1)` clears the rightmost 1-bit of `n`. You can repeat this process until `n` becomes zero.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  n = 7 = 0111 (binary)
  n = n & (n - 1) → 0111 & 0110 = 0110 (binary)
  n = n & (n - 1) → 0110 & 0101 = 0100 (binary)
  n = n & (n - 1) → 0100 & 0011 = 0000 (binary)
  ```
  This will require 3 iterations to reach 0, so there are 3 set bits in 7.

---

#### **Generating subsets using bit manipulation**
- **Explanation**: Each subset of a set can be represented by a unique combination of bits in a binary number. By iterating over all possible bit combinations, you can generate all subsets of a given set. This is done by looping over numbers from 0 to `2^n - 1` where `n` is the number of elements in the set, and using each number's binary representation to pick elements from the set.

- **Example**:
  For the set `{1, 2, 3}`, the binary numbers 000 to 111 represent all subsets:
  ```
  000 → {}
  001 → {3}
  010 → {2}
  011 → {2, 3}
  100 → {1}
  101 → {1, 3}
  110 → {1, 2}
  111 → {1, 2, 3}
  ```

### **3. Common Techniques:**

#### **Get Bit**
- **Explanation**: To check whether the i-th bit is set (1) or not (0), you can use the bitwise AND operation. By shifting 1 to the left by `i` positions (`1 << i`), you create a mask that isolates the i-th bit. If the result of `num & (1 << i)` is non-zero, the bit is set; otherwise, it is not.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  num = 5 = 0101 (binary)
  i = 2
  num & (1 << i) = 0101 & 0100 = 0100 → non-zero, so the bit at position 2 is set.
  ```

#### **Set Bit**
- **Explanation**: To set the i-th bit (make it 1), you can use the OR operator with a bitmask that has only the i-th bit set (`1 << i`). The OR operation ensures that the i-th bit becomes 1, while all other bits remain unchanged.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  num = 5 = 0101 (binary)
  i = 1
  num | (1 << i) = 0101 | 0010 = 0111 → the bit at position 1 is now set.
  ```

#### **Clear Bit**
- **Explanation**: To clear the i-th bit (make it 0), you can use the AND operator with a mask where only the i-th bit is 0 and all other bits are 1

. This is done by using `~(1 << i)` to invert the bitmask.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  num = 5 = 0101 (binary)
  i = 2
  num & ~(1 << i) = 0101 & 1011 = 0001 → the bit at position 2 is cleared.
  ```

#### **Toggle Bit**
- **Explanation**: To toggle (flip) the i-th bit, you use the XOR operator with a bitmask that has only the i-th bit set. If the i-th bit is 0, it becomes 1; if it's 1, it becomes 0.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  num = 5 = 0101 (binary)
  i = 1
  num ^ (1 << i) = 0101 ^ 0010 = 0111 → the bit at position 1 is toggled.
  ```

### **4. Two’s Complement:**

- **Explanation**: Two’s complement is a method for representing negative numbers in binary. To obtain the two’s complement of a number, you invert all the bits and then add 1. This representation is widely used because it allows for simpler arithmetic operations.

- **Example**:
  To find the two’s complement of 5:
  - Step 1: Invert all bits of 5 (0101 → 1010).
  - Step 2: Add 1 to the result: 1010 + 1 = 1011.
  The two’s complement of 5 is `1011`, which represents -5 in binary.

These concepts and techniques are fundamental to understanding bit manipulation and its applications, such as optimizing memory usage, performing fast arithmetic, and working with hardware-level data.

Thanks for sharing the articles! Here's a quick summary of key concepts from them, which will help guide us as we dive into the problems you want to solve with bit manipulation.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Bitwise Operators**:
   - **AND (`&`)**: Compares bits; sets the result bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
   - **OR (`|`)**: Sets the result bit to 1 if either bit is 1.
   - **XOR (`^`)**: Sets the result bit to 1 if exactly one of the two bits is 1 (i.e., they differ).
   - **NOT (`~`)**: Flips all bits (1s become 0s and 0s become 1s).
   - **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left, effectively multiplying the number by powers of 2.
   - **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right, dividing the number by powers of 2.

2. **Applications of Bitwise Operations**:
   - Checking if a number is a power of 2 (`x & (x - 1) == 0`).
   - Counting the number of 1-bits in a number (`n = n & (n - 1)`).
   - Generating subsets using bit manipulation.
   - Setting, clearing, and toggling specific bits using operations like `|`, `&`, and `^`.

3. **Common Techniques**:
   - **Get Bit**: Use `num & (1 << i)` to check if the i-th bit is set.
   - **Set Bit**: Use `num | (1 << i)` to set the i-th bit.
   - **Clear Bit**: Use `num & ~(1 << i)` to clear (unset) the i-th bit.
   - **Toggle Bit**: Use `num ^ (1 << i)` to flip the i-th bit.

4. **Two’s Complement**:
   - Represents negative numbers. Inverting all bits and adding 1 gives the negative counterpart.

### Now, let's dive into the problems. Here’s a breakdown of how each one can be approached:

---

### **1. Check if the i-th bit is set or not**

- **Explanation**: You can use the bitwise AND operator to check if a specific bit is set. If the result is non-zero, the bit is set.
  
- **Solution**:
  ```cpp
  bool checkIfBitIsSet(int num, int i) {
      return (num & (1 << i)) != 0;
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Check if a number is odd or not**

- **Explanation**: A number is odd if its least significant bit (LSB) is 1. You can check this by performing `num & 1`. If the result is 1, the number is odd.

- **Solution**:
  ```cpp
  bool isOdd(int num) {
      return (num & 1) != 0;
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Check if a number is power of 2**

- **Explanation**: A number is a power of 2 if it has only one bit set. The property `x & (x - 1) == 0` works for this check.
  
- **Solution**:
  ```cpp
  bool isPowerOfTwo(int x) {
      return (x > 0) && (x & (x - 1)) == 0;
  }
  ```

---

### **4. Count the number of set bits**

- **Explanation**: You can use the approach `n = n & (n - 1)` to efficiently count the number of set bits. This operation reduces the number of set bits by one each time.

- **Solution**:
  ```cpp
  int countSetBits(int n) {
      int count = 0;
      while (n) {
          n = n & (n - 1);
          count++;
      }
      return count;
  }
  ```

---

### **5. Set/Unset the rightmost unset bit**

- **Explanation**: The rightmost unset bit can be toggled using a bitwise operation. To set the rightmost unset bit, use `num | (num + 1)`. To unset it, you can do `num & (num - 1)`.

- **Solution (Set)**:
  ```cpp
  int setRightmostUnsetBit(int num) {
      return num | (num + 1);
  }
  ```
  
- **Solution (Unset)**:
  ```cpp
  int unsetRightmostUnsetBit(int num) {
      return num & (num - 1);
  }
  ```

---

### **6. Swap two numbers**

- **Explanation**: You can swap two numbers without a temporary variable using XOR. `a = a ^ b; b = a ^ b; a = a ^ b;` will swap `a` and `b`.

- **Solution**:
  ```cpp
  void swap(int &a, int &b) {
      a = a ^ b;
      b = a ^ b;
      a = a ^ b;
  }
  ```

---

### **7. Divide two integers without using multiplication, division, or mod operator**

- **Explanation**: You can use bit shifting to simulate division. Dividing by powers of 2 is equivalent to shifting right. For general division, you can subtract multiples of the divisor using bit shifts (like long division).

- **Solution (for powers of 2)**:
  ```cpp
  int divideByPowerOfTwo(int num, int power) {
      return num >> power;
  }
  ```
