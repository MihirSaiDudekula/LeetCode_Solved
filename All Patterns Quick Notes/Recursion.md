1. Recursion is basically a function calling itself. within the function body,whenever we encounter a call to the same function(recursive call), we need to go back to the first line of the function body and start executing again.

2.But just before going back to line 1, we push all our current progress (the variables,etc.) into a function call stack.

3.on each function call, the call is added to the call stack and whenever we encounter the `return` statement, the function is popped from the call stack

4.so, this process of adding to call stack goes on until a base case is satisfied. base case is that case of recursion which indicates the end of the process. usually, it is determined by one of the variables that are saved in the call stack(in point no.2)
`syntax`
```java
if(/*condition*/)
{
    /*final remaining process*/
    return;
}
```

5.the return value of the recursion depends on what type of data the function returns. the variables and data structures like(arraylist,set,etc) must be passed by reference for modification of the actual structure. so if the current function doesnt have the required return type and parameters, define a new function and recurse it.

6. once a particular call reaches return, it exits from the call stack and goes back to the `next line of the previous call`. that is -> it goes back to the line which had called it and continues from there. the data for that is stored at the topmost call of the call stack.

7.while drawing the recursion tree of the recursion. for a particular node , the number of branches that emerge out from it , is equal to the number of recursive calls in the code.

ex: in fibonacci sequence code :
`return fibo(n-1)+fibo(n-2)`

can be re written as 
`int x = fibo(n-1)
 int y = fibo(n-2)
 return x+y`

 so if n were to be 5, from 5, the node for 4 originates on 1 side and 3 originates on the other side. this indicates the prescence of 2 recursive calls in single function body - a hint in problem solving.

this is more apparent in permutations questions and merge sort algo

8.The number of branches need not be constant either,(like fibo has a constant 2), in permutation based problems, it varies at each level, so these calls are then put into for/while loops.

```java
for (i=0;i<n;i++) {
    funcs(a,b,i);
}
```

### **Understanding Recursion in Java: Parameters vs. Local Variables with Data Structures**  

Just like in Python, when a recursive function is called in Java, each call has **its own execution context**. However, Java has **pass-by-value semantics**, which behaves differently for **primitive types** and **objects (including lists, arrays, trees, etc.)**.

### **Key Observations in Java**  
1. **Primitive types (like `int`, `double`) are passed by value** – Each recursive call gets a **new copy** of the primitive.  
2. **Objects (like `ArrayList`, arrays, trees) are passed by reference** – The reference to the object is passed by value, meaning all recursive calls operate on the **same object in memory**.
3. **Each recursive call has its own stack frame**, meaning local variables inside the function **are unique to each call**.

---

## **Example 1: Modifying a List Recursively**
Let’s implement the equivalent of `modify_list()` from Python in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RecursionExample {
    public static void modifyList(List<Integer> lst, int i) {
        if (i == lst.size()) {
            return; // Base case
        }
        lst.set(i, lst.get(i) + 1); // Modify list in place
        modifyList(lst, i + 1); // Recursive call with updated index
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
        modifyList(lst, 0);
        System.out.println(lst); // Output: [2, 3, 4]
    }
}
```

### **How Variables Are Handled Here?**  

| Call                  | `lst` (Same Object) | `i` (New Copy) |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `modifyList([1,2,3], 0)`  | `[2,2,3]`   | `i = 0` |
| `modifyList([2,2,3], 1)`  | `[2,3,3]`   | `i = 1` |
| `modifyList([2,3,3], 2)`  | `[2,3,4]`   | `i = 2` |

### **Key Takeaways:**
- `lst` is a **mutable object**, and since Java passes object **references** by value, **all function calls modify the same list in memory**.
- `i` is a **primitive integer**, so **each recursive call gets a new copy** of `i`, isolating its value across different calls.
- **Each recursive call gets a new workspace**, where local variables exist **only for that call**.

# THE ONE QUESTION THAT CLARIFIES A LOT :

You have n dice, and each dice has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target

- basically, you must use one number per dice
- cannot take 2 nums from 1 dice
- must take all dies, necessarily, cannot omit the op of any die or consider it 0
# Detailed Explanation of the Dice Sum Solution

## Overview of the Solution

This solution elegantly solves the problem of finding the number of ways to roll `n` dice (each with `k` faces) to get a sum of `target`. Let's break down each component and understand why it works so well.

## The Main Function: `numRollsToTarget`

```java
public int numRollsToTarget(int n, int k, int target) {
    int ways = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<=k; i++) {
        ways = (ways + rec(k, n, i, 1, target)) % mod;
    }
    return ways;
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Initializes a counter `ways` to track the total number of ways
2. Iterates through all possible values for the first die (1 to k)
3. For each value of the first die, calls the recursive function to find all ways to get the remaining sum with the remaining dice
4. Accumulates the results while taking modulo to prevent integer overflow

**Brilliance in design:**
- Handles the first die separately to kickstart the recursion process
- This approach avoids one level of recursion by making the first decision upfront
- By starting with an actual value for the first die, we're already working with a concrete path toward our target

## The Recursive Function: `rec`

```java
public int rec(int faces, int dies, int runsum, int elems, int target) {
    if(runsum > target) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    if(elems == dies) {
        if(runsum == target) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    int ways = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<=faces; i++) {
        ways = (ways + rec(faces, dies, runsum+i, elems+1, target)) % mod;
    }
    
    return ways;
}
```

**Parameters explained:**
- `faces`: The number of faces on each die (k)
- `dies`: Total number of dice (n)
- `runsum`: Current running sum of the dice values so far
- `elems`: Number of dice that have been rolled so far
- `target`: The target sum we're trying to reach

**Base cases:**
1. If `runsum > target`, we return 0 since we've already exceeded our target (optimization)
2. If `elems == dies` (used all dice), we check if we've hit our target:
   - If `runsum == target`, we found a valid way (return 1)
   - Otherwise, we didn't reach the target (return 0)

**Recursive case:**
- For each possible face value (1 to k) on the current die
- Recursively count ways by adding the current face value to the running sum
- Increment the dice counter by 1
- Accumulate the total ways while taking modulo

## The Brilliance of Using a Ways Accumulator

The local `ways` variable inside the recursive function acts as a "sum accumulator" which is particularly brilliant for this problem for several reasons:

1. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of storing all possible combinations in memory (e.g., using an ArrayList), we simply count them. This is much more memory-efficient.

2. **Incremental Calculation**: As each recursive call returns its count, we add it to our running total. This builds up the solution piece by piece.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: By applying the modulo operation at each step, we prevent integer overflow while calculating large numbers.

4. **Avoids Backtracking Complexity**: Traditional backtracking would require maintaining a list of chosen values, but here we just track the sum and dice count, which is much cleaner.

## How the Ways Variable Is Different

The `ways` variable is fundamentally different from the other parameters:

- It's not a parameter passed to the recursive function but a local variable within it
- It accumulates results from all possible choices at the current decision point
- It represents the total count of valid paths from the current state to the goal state
- Unlike `faces`, `dies`, `runsum`, and `elems` which describe the current state of the recursion, `ways` tracks the result of all future paths from that state

## Could We Use a Void-Type Recursive Function?

Yes, we could implement this using a void-type recursive function, but it would require:

1. A global/class-level variable to accumulate the count
2. Modifying this variable in-place when valid combinations are found

For example:
```java
class Solution {
    int mod = 1_000_000_007;
    int totalWays = 0;
    
    public int numRollsToTarget(int n, int k, int target) {
        totalWays = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<=k; i++) {
            recVoid(k, n, i, 1, target);
        }
        return totalWays;
    }
    
    public void recVoid(int faces, int dies, int runsum, int elems, int target) {
        if(runsum > target) {
            return;
        }
        
        if(elems == dies) {
            if(runsum == target) {
                totalWays = (totalWays + 1) % mod;
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for(int i=1; i<=faces; i++) {
            recVoid(faces, dies, runsum+i, elems+1, target);
        }
    }
}
```


## **Building Intuition for Backtracking and Tree Problems**  

### **Backtracking Example: Generating All Subsequences**
Backtracking problems rely on **passing a reference to a mutable data structure** (e.g., `ArrayList`) while ensuring **each recursive call has its own state**.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Subsets {
    public static void generateSubsets(List<Integer> nums, int index, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        if (index == nums.size()) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(current)); // Store a copy of current
            return;
        }
        
        // Exclude the current element
        generateSubsets(nums, index + 1, current, result);     
        // Include the current element
        current.add(nums.get(index));
        generateSubsets(nums, index + 1, current, result);    // Backtrack (remove last added element)
        current.remove(current.size() - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        generateSubsets(nums, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

### **How Variables Are Handled in Each Recursive Call?**
| Call | `index` (New Copy) | `current` (Same Object, Modified) |
|------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| `generateSubsets([1,2,3], 0, [])` | `0` | `[]` |
| `generateSubsets([1,2,3], 1, [])` | `1` | `[]` |
| `generateSubsets([1,2,3], 2, [])` | `2` | `[]` |
| `generateSubsets([1,2,3], 2, [3])` | `2` | `[3]` |
| `generateSubsets([1,2,3], 1, [2])` | `1` | `[2]` |

### **Key Observations for Backtracking:**
- The `current` list **remains the same object**, but each function call **modifies and restores it (backtracks)**.
- `index` is **passed by value**, meaning each call **gets a unique copy of `index`**.
- **A copy of `current` is stored at the base case** to prevent unwanted modifications in future calls.

---

## **Tree Problems: Recursion with Nodes**
Recursion is commonly used to traverse trees. Since **nodes are objects**, they are **passed by reference**, allowing modifications across recursive calls.

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class TreeTraversal {
    public static void inorder(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        inorder(root.left);
        System.out.print(root.val + " ");
        inorder(root.right);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1);
        root.left = new TreeNode(2);
        root.right = new TreeNode(3);
        inorder(root); // Output: 2 1 3
    }
}
```

### **How Variables Are Handled Here?**
- `root` is a **mutable object (TreeNode)**, so all function calls operate on the same memory object.
- `root.left` and `root.right` are **different references**, allowing traversal.
- Each recursive call gets a **new stack frame**, maintaining its own `root` reference.

---

## **Building Intuition for Recursion and Backtracking**
1. **Each recursive call is an isolated instance**: It has **its own copy of primitive values** but **shares mutable objects**.
2. **Lists and trees (mutable objects) are modified in-place**: They **persist across calls**, requiring careful handling in backtracking.
3. **Backtracking restores state before returning**: We must **undo changes** before returning to the previous call to avoid corruption.
4. **Tree traversal follows a natural recursive structure**: Recursive calls **process subtrees** while retaining the root node reference.

Converting an iterative solution (like one that uses a loop) into a recursive solution involves mapping each component of the loop into its recursive counterpart. Here’s a general procedure:

### 1. **Identify the Loop Components**

- **Initialization:**  
  Determine what the loop starts with (e.g., `i = 0` in a `for` loop). This will typically become an argument to the recursive function that tracks the current state.

- **Termination Condition (Base Case):**  
  The loop stops when a certain condition is met (e.g., `i == n`). This condition becomes your **base case** in recursion, where you stop making further recursive calls.

- **Iteration/Update Step:**  
  Inside the loop, the loop variable is updated (for instance, `i++` in a `for` loop). In recursion, this update is reflected by calling the recursive function with a modified parameter (e.g., `recursive(i+1)`).

- **Loop Body (Core Operation):**  
  Identify what the loop is doing at each iteration (e.g., processing an element in an array, accumulating a sum, etc.). This operation will be performed in the recursive case before or after the recursive call, depending on the logic (pre-order, post-order, or tail recursion).

### 2. **Outline the Recursive Structure**

- **Base Case:**  
  Write a condition that checks if you have reached the end condition (similar to the loop’s termination condition). If true, return a result or simply terminate the recursion.

- **Recursive Case:**  
  - Perform the operations that are done inside the loop body.
  - Update the state (e.g., increment the index).
  - Make a recursive call with the updated state.

### 3. **Example Conversion**

**Iterative Example (Summing Elements of an Array):**

```python
def iterative_sum(arr):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        total += arr[i]
    return total
```

**Recursive Equivalent:**

1. **Identify the parts:**
   - **Initialization:** Start at index `0`.
   - **Termination/Base Case:** When the index equals the length of the array.
   - **Update:** Increment the index by 1.
   - **Operation:** Add the current element to the cumulative sum.

2. **Write the recursive function:**

```python
def recursive_sum(arr, i=0):
    # Base case: If we've processed all elements, return 0
    if i == len(arr):
        return 0
    # Recursive case: Sum the current element and the sum of the rest
    return arr[i] + recursive_sum(arr, i+1)
```

In this recursive function:
- **Initialization:** We start with `i=0`.
- **Base Case:** When `i` equals `len(arr)`, we return `0` (since there’s nothing left to add).
- **Recursive Call:** We add `arr[i]` to the result of `recursive_sum(arr, i+1)`, effectively mimicking the `i++` step in the loop.

### 4. **General Procedure for Conversion**

1. **Define the Recursive Function:**  
   Create a function that accepts parameters representing the loop’s state (like an index or pointer).

2. **Set Up the Base Case:**  
   Determine the condition that signals the end of recursion (the same condition that ends the loop).

3. **Replicate the Loop Body:**  
   Implement the core operations performed in each iteration of the loop.

4. **Include the Recursive Call:**  
   Call the recursive function with an updated state (e.g., incremented index) to mimic the loop’s progression.

5. **Combine and Return:**  
   Return the result of the current operation combined with the result of the recursive call, if needed.

### 5. **Tips and Considerations**

- **Tail Recursion:**  
  If your operation involves accumulating a value (like summing elements), you can sometimes optimize using tail recursion by passing the accumulator as an extra parameter.

- **Stack Usage:**  
  Keep in mind that recursive solutions use the call stack, so for very deep recursion (large loops), you might hit recursion limits or run into performance issues compared to iterative solutions.

- **Clarity Over Cleverness:**  
  While recursion can simplify some problems (especially those that are naturally recursive, like tree traversals), not every iterative solution will be more understandable when written recursively. Use recursion where it adds clarity or is required by the problem structure.

By following these steps, you can convert almost any iterative loop into a recursive function. This mapping—initialization to function parameters, loop termination to base case, and iterative updates to recursive calls—provides a systematic approach to reworking iterative solutions into recursive ones.

9.Backtracking: is the process in which we revert any changes made to the shared data structure (the array, which is modified at each recursion call), to which if we hadd added something , we need to remove before exiting from the stack after the reuired work is completed.

```java
  combo.add(candidates[i]);
  backtrack(candidates, combo, sum+ candidates[i], target, result, i);
  combo.remove(combo.size() - 1);
```

we make an addition to the combo array,then we remove the addition,
note the sum variable , it doesnt need subtraction in the backtracking part, simply because, 
1. its a uniue value for each fn call in the stack
2. its not modified in the function body,it is modified only when passing, so dont have to change it later 


10.DP is an extension of multiple recursion. the idea is to memoize existing recursion trees instead of rebuilding them



I'll provide a detailed explanation of recursion and its related concepts, using clear examples and building from fundamentals to more complex ideas.

Let's start with a practical example that we'll use throughout - calculating the factorial of a number (5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1). This will help illustrate each point clearly.

1. **The Core Concept of Recursion**
```java
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n-1);  // Recursive call
}
```
When we call `factorial(5)`, each time we hit the recursive call `factorial(n-1)`, it's like starting a new version of our function. Think of it like opening a new copy of the same book - you keep your finger on your current page (line) while starting to read the book again from the beginning with a different number.

2. **The Call Stack - Saving Our Progress**
When calculating factorial(5), each time we make a recursive call, we need to remember where we were and what we were doing. The call stack stores this information like a stack of sticky notes:
```
Note 5: n=5, waiting to multiply by factorial(4)
Note 4: n=4, waiting to multiply by factorial(3)
Note 3: n=3, waiting to multiply by factorial(2)
Note 2: n=2, waiting to multiply by factorial(1)
Note 1: n=1, base case!
```
Each note contains all the local variables and the exact line where we paused.

3. **Stack Operations**
Think of the call stack like a stack of plates. When we make a new recursive call, we put a new plate on top (push). When we return from a call, we take the top plate off (pop). For our factorial example:
```
Push: factorial(5)
Push: factorial(4)
Push: factorial(3)
Push: factorial(2)
Push: factorial(1)  // Base case reached!
Pop: factorial(1) returns 1
Pop: factorial(2) returns 2 * 1
Pop: factorial(3) returns 3 * 2
Pop: factorial(4) returns 4 * 6
Pop: factorial(5) returns 5 * 24
```

4. **Base Cases - The Foundation**
The base case is like the ground floor of a building - it's where we stop digging deeper. Let's look at a string reversal example:
```java
String reverse(String str) {
    // Base case: empty string or single character
    if (str.length() <= 1) {
        return str;  // No need to reverse
    }
    // Recursive case: first character goes to end
    return reverse(str.substring(1)) + str.charAt(0);
}
```

5. **Return Values and References**
When working with data structures, we often need to modify them directly. Here's an example of generating all subsets of a list:
```java
void generateSubsets(List<Integer> nums, List<List<Integer>> result, 
                    List<Integer> current, int index) {
    // The result list is passed by reference and modified directly
    result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
    
    for (int i = index; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        current.add(nums.get(i));
        generateSubsets(nums, result, current, i + 1);
        current.remove(current.size() - 1);
    }
}
```

6. **Stack Unwinding - The Journey Back**
When a recursive call returns, we continue from exactly where we left off. In merge sort, this is crucial:
```java
void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);      // Sort left half
        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right); // Sort right half
        merge(arr, left, mid, right);   // Combine results
    }
}
```
After sorting both halves recursively, we combine them using the saved information about where each half begins and ends.

7. **Recursion Trees**
The Fibonacci sequence beautifully demonstrates recursive branching:
```java
int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    // Two branches at each step
    int leftBranch = fib(n-1);
    int rightBranch = fib(n-2);
    return leftBranch + rightBranch;
}
```
For fib(5), each call creates two more calls, forming a tree-like structure where each node splits into two branches.

8. **Variable Branching**
In generating permutations, the number of recursive calls varies based on remaining choices:
```java
void permute(List<Integer> nums, List<Integer> current, 
            boolean[] used, List<List<Integer>> result) {
    if (current.size() == nums.size()) {
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
        return;
    }
    // Number of branches depends on remaining unused numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (!used[i]) {
            used[i] = true;
            current.add(nums.get(i));
            permute(nums, current, used, result);
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }
}
```

9. **Backtracking**
In the N-Queens problem, we place queens and remove them when we hit dead ends:
```java
boolean solveNQueens(int[][] board, int col, int N) {
    if (col >= N) return true;
    
    for (int row = 0; row < N; row++) {
        if (isSafe(board, row, col)) {
            board[row][col] = 1;  // Place queen
            
            if (solveNQueens(board, col + 1, N)) {
                return true;
            }
            
            board[row][col] = 0;  // Remove queen (backtrack)
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

10. **Dynamic Programming Extension**
We can improve recursive solutions by remembering previous results:
```java
Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

int fibDP(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    if (memo.containsKey(n)) return memo.get(n);
    
    int result = fibDP(n-1) + fibDP(n-2);
    memo.put(n, result);  // Remember this result
    return result;
}
```
# Recursion Pattern Guide

## 1. Problem Identification
Key indicators that a problem should use recursion:
- Problem can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems
- Tree/Graph traversal problems
- Problems involving combinations or permutations
- Need to explore all possibilities (backtracking)
- Keywords like:
  - "All possible ways"
  - "Generate all"
  - "Print all paths"
  - "Find combinations"
  - "Tree traversal"
  - "Divide and conquer"

## 2. General Steps for Solving Recursive Problems

### Basic Steps
1. **Identify Base Case(s)**
   - Simplest possible input
   - Condition to stop recursion
   - Usually handles empty/single element

2. **Define Recursive Case**
   - Break problem into smaller sub-problems
   - Make problem smaller in each call
   - Combine sub-results appropriately

3. **Ensure Progress Towards Base Case**
   - Parameter must move towards base case
   - Avoid infinite recursion
   - Validate input reduction

### Common Recursive Patterns

1. **Linear Recursion**
   - Single recursive call
   - Often used for linear data structures

2. **Binary Recursion**
   - Two recursive calls
   - Common in divide-and-conquer

3. **Multiple Recursion**
   - More than two recursive calls
   - Used in combinatorial problems

4. **Tail Recursion**
   - Recursive call is last operation
   - Can be optimized by compiler

## 3. General Templates

```java
public class RecursionPatterns {
    // Basic Linear Recursion Template
    public int linearRecursion(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case
        return n + linearRecursion(n - 1);
    }
    
    // Binary Tree Recursion Template
    public void treeRecursion(TreeNode root) {
        // Base case
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        // Process current node
        process(root);
        // Recursive cases
        treeRecursion(root.left);
        treeRecursion(root.right);
    }
    
    // Backtracking Template
    public void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> current, int[] nums, int start) {
        // Add current combination
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
        
        // Try all possibilities from current position
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Make choice
            current.add(nums[i]);
            // Recurse
            backtrack(result, current, nums, i + 1);
            // Undo choice
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Divide and Conquer Template
    public int divideConquer(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        // Base case
        if (left == right) {
            return arr[left];
        }
        
        // Divide
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        // Conquer
        int leftResult = divideConquer(arr, left, mid);
        int rightResult = divideConquer(arr, mid + 1, right);
        
        // Combine
        return combine(leftResult, rightResult);
    }
    
    // Path Finding Template
    public void findPaths(int[][] grid, int row, int col, List<String> path, List<List<String>> result) {
        // Base cases
        if (!isValid(grid, row, col)) return;
        if (isDestination(row, col)) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
            return;
        }
        
        // Recursive cases - try all directions
        int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int newRow = row + dir[0];
            int newCol = col + dir[1];
            path.add(getDirection(dir));
            findPaths(grid, newRow, newCol, path, result);
            path.remove(path.size() - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
